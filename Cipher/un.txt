Austen presents Mr. Darcy’s attitude to society as quite bad in this extract. Darcy is shown to believe that society is governed by strict rules and conventions and he sticks to them meticulously. Whilst he is right that in the Regency period in England society’s expectations on introductions were rigid, he does have friends who could introduce him to new people. In the passage, when Elizabeth mocks him for not engaging with society at the first ball, he excuses himself by saying, “I had not at the time the honour of knowing and lady in the assembly beyond my own party.” Austen’s use of the word, “honour” shows that Darcy thinks it would be and “honour” to know other people but that he cannot introduce himself, and therefore sticking to convention. However, he precludes this with the negative use of, “had not,” demonstrating his negative attitude. The reader should acknowledge, however, that they are perhaps influenced by Elizabeth’s opinion of his attitude to society after this ball which happened earlier on in the novel. Thus we are entirely convinced that Darcy’s attitude to society is negative.
