Welcome to a collection of my *amazing* work.

Before using my programs it is recomended to read the LICENCE file in this repository.

Feel free to use any file here in any way you want*. 

Many of my programs are no longer in development so the will most likely have a few bugs

If you find a bug in my programs please post an issue in the issue tracker and I will try and fix it.

Note: Python programs are targeted at the latest version of python3.

DISCLAMER: I accept no responsibility for any loss or damage caused by any of my programs,
 for help or questions please post an issue and I will try to fix your problem.

*Please do not recieve any credit or money for my work as you it is not yours.
